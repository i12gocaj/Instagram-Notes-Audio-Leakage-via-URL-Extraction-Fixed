# 🎙️ Instagram Notes Audio Leakage via URL Extraction (Fixed & Rewarded)

🛡️ Vulnerability Summary

In [05/2025], I discovered a vulnerability in Instagram Web that allowed any user to extract the **original video file** from a Note and access the **background audio**, which was not meant to be publicly available. This bypassed the privacy model of the Notes feature, where videos are supposed to be displayed silently.

⚠️ This vulnerability has been **responsibly disclosed, validated, and fixed**.
I reported it to Meta via their Bug Bounty Program and was awarded **$1000** for this finding.  
**Case ID:** `3950957211809485`

🔍 Impact

By inspecting the element and copying the direct video URL, any user could retrieve the original video — **including audio** — even though Instagram Notes are designed to suppress audio playback. This exposed private conversations, ambient sounds, or unintended background content uploaded by the user.

🧪 Proof of Concept

Steps:
1. Open Instagram Web and view any video Note.
2. Open browser DevTools (Right-click > Inspect).
3. Locate the `<video>` or `<source>` tag and copy the `src` URL.
4. Paste the URL in a new tab.
5. The original video plays **with full audio**, bypassing the frontend's muted design.

📄 Responsible Disclosure

Meta acknowledged and validated the issue, awarding a **$1000 bounty** as part of their bug bounty program. The issue has since been silently patched.
